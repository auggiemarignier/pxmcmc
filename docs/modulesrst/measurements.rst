Measurements
============

Measurement operators operate on some image `X` to predict observations `Y`.  Adjoints operate on measurements to return some image.

.. note::
   
   We use the terms `image` and `pixels` in this documentation because the code was originally written for 2D imaging problems.  In general, `pixels` should be taken to mean `parameters` in the space in which the measurement operator gets applied.
