Forward
=======

This module provides the base class :class:`.ForwardOperator`.  This operator combines transformation and measurement operators for forward modelling and calculation of the gradient of data fidelity for a given MCMC sample.  This is the block of the MCMC algorithms that holds all the data.  A couple of simple operators are also given that can be used out of the box.
