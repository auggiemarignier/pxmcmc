# Python ProxMCMC

## Installation
Installation is done using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).  Having cloned the repo simply run 
```
poetry install
source <ENVIRONMENT_LOCATION>/bin/activate
pytest
```

For the forward operators that require ```pys2let```, I have been using my local installation of ```pys2let```.  Need to get this working with pip/poetry.
